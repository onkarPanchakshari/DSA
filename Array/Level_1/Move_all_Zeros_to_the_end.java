/**
 *
 *  Optimal Approach(Using 2 pointers): 
   We can optimize the approach using 2 pointers i.e. i and j. 
   The pointer j will point to the first 0 in the array and i will point to the next index.

  Assume, the given array is {1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1}. 
  Now, initially, we will place the 2-pointers like the following:

   The algorithm will be the following.

Algorithm:
First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element: We will swap a[i] and a[j]. Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i].
So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.
